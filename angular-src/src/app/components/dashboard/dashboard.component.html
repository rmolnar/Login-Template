	Hello, {{username}}!

<p>
	This is your dashboard. There is nothing here! That's because this login system is application agnostic. The "dashboard" serves as a placeholder for whatever service your application will deliver and needs to be protected by a user authentication system.<br/><br/> If you are reading this, thanks for examining my application.
